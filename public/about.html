    <p>Today we are introducing Loi'hi <code>Shell Protocol</code>, an automated market maker that allows you to trade between stablecoins in a decentralized fashion with very low slippage.</p>
    <p>Loi'hi lives on Etherum mainnet at address <code>0x06AF07097C9Eeb7fD685c692751D5C66dB49c215</code>.</p>
    <p class="logo"> </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-automated-market-maker-">What is an automated market maker?</h2>
    <p> Automated market makers are smart contracts that contain logic by which trades are made. Users with extra capital can deposit it into the Shell Protocol and partake in the trading fees. </p>
    <p> The Shell Protocol is designed specifically for trading stablecoins, which means that everything trades more or less at a 1:1 parity between pairs. </p>
    <p> Every time a trade is executed, a small fee is kept by the protocol. These fees accrue to the holders of Shell Tokens, which is what the user receives in return for staking their capital to the protocol.</p>
    <h2 id="what-are-shell-tokens-">What are shell tokens?</h2>
    <p> Every time a user provides liquidity to the pools of the Shell Protocol, they receive Shell tokens representing their contribution to that particular pool. </p>
    <p> As the pools gain fees through trades, the Shell Tokens accrue these fees and become more valuable. As the pool processes transactions, the stablecoins that Shell tokens are redeemable for increases. </p>
    <h2 id="deposits-and-withdrawals-">Deposits and Withdrawals </h2>
    <p> Users can deposit into the pool selectively or proportionally. That means they can deposit any number of any supported coin, or they can have the contract calculate what value of each supported coin the user will deposit as to avoid any slippage. </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-slippage">What is slippage? </h2>
    <p> In standard trading, slippage is the gap between the bid and the ask, which are both submitted by users. However, in an automated market maker, prices aren't set by users. They are set by the bonding curve. </p>
    <p> An automated market maker's bonding curve can be designed in several ways. Slippage plays an integral role in each of them - it is what allows the prices to stay in line with the market. </p>
    <p> When a trade is made in an automated market maker, it changes the balances of the residing liquidity, and therefore it also changes the price of the assets. The change in this price in relation to the size of the trade is what comprises slippage for an automated market maker. </p>
    <p> Due to slippage, autmated market makers can move along with the market external to it. If there is an arbitrage opportunity, users will buy low on an automated market maker and sell high at another exchange, driving all prices to equilibrium. </p>
<h3 id="support-for-gasless-token-interactions">Support for gasless token interactions</h3>
<p>Paying gas for transactions that primarily deal with tokens creates unnecessary friction and positions tokens as second-class citizens in the Ethereum ecosystem. While there are many ways of dealing with this problem, both the Chai and the Dai contract provide a particularly simple and general solution by allowing approvals to be done with a signed message (known as a <code>permit</code>) in the ERC20 directly.</p>
<p>While designing the <code>dai.sol</code> token contract, we experimented with various ways of performing token operations using signatures, until we realized that the only operation that had to be added to the contract directly was <code>permit</code>. </p>
<p>By allowing users to give allowance to arbitrary addresses by signing a <code>permit</code>, we allow abstract gasless operations without committing to a particular way of doing transfer-by-signature, trade-by-signature, or any other token interaction. We achieve full generality by just adding one function to the ERC20 standard. In fact, one of the reasons we felt compelled to write the <code>Chai</code> contract was because we wanted Savings Dai deposits to have this feature. </p>
<p>Note that the interface at <a href="https://chai.money">chai.money</a> does not yet support gasless transfers, but we are working on a something that demonstrates the full power of the <code>permit</code> pattern. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The <code>Chai</code> contract has not yet undergone an audit. Although we believe it to be straightforward enough to not contain any surprises, remember that on the blockchain, you are responsible for your own actions.</p>
